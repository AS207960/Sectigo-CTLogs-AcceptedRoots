This log accepts all roots that are enabled for the server authentication trust purpose in one or more of the Microsoft, Mozilla, Chrome, Apple, and 360 Browser root programs.
We will update this log's list of accepted roots from time to time in accordance with this policy.

This log is [included in Google Chrome since M60](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=703700).

During 2023, we plan to create new temporally-sharded logs to replace the original Sabre log.
