# Sectigo [Certificate Transparency](http://www.certificate-transparency.org/) Logs: Accepted Roots
Sectigo's CT logs are powered by [ct-server](https://github.com/google/certificate-transparency).

[Sectigo Mammoth](crt/mammoth) and [Sectigo Sabre](crt/sabre) are our production logs, which accept all root certificates that are trusted for the server authentication trust purpose in one or more of the Microsoft, Mozilla and Apple root programs.

[Sectigo Dodo](crt/dodo) is our non-production log, which accepts all root certificates that are trusted for any trust purpose in one or more of the Microsoft, Mozilla, Apple, Java and Android root programs, as well as various roots that are no longer trusted or are not yet trusted. Note that we welcome and will consider [Pull Requests to add other root certificates](CONTRIBUTING.md) to Dodo.
